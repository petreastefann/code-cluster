/*
this is a project containing different types of exercises sorted by (may i say) difficulty.
the types of exercises are, for example, dynamic programming, data structures, automatons,
or just simple operations like number manipulation.
the reason i created this project and why i will update it regularly is for newbies to have some content to learn from.
