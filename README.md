# exercise cluster

this is a project containing different types of exercises, for example: dynamic programming, data structures, or just simple operations like number manipulation. the reason i created this project and why i will update it regularly is mostly for beginners to have some content to learn from.

### in the cpp folder

level 0 consists of introductory concepts.
level 1 -> etc. are based on "difficulty"

### the python folder

currently consists of school homework as i am still learning the language
(TODO: add data science in here)

etc..
